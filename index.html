  <h1>My Cat</h1>
  <h2>About him</h2>
  <p style="border-color: lightslategray;">Aeg is about 4 months old. We got him from my boyfriend's friend's cat that had kittens. He is a crazy little cat and will run around the entire apartment making loops. When he runs around he will run into doors, bathtub and cabinets. </p>
